Project Overview:
This project focuses on conducting Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) to understand the underlying structure of personality items. The analysis explores different factor solutions (4, 5, 6, and 7 factors) using R Studio (version 3).

Analysis Summary:
Parallel Analysis:

Six factors were identified based on eigenvalues obtained from simulated random data.
Suggested that a six-factor solution is appropriate for interpreting the underlying structure of personality items.
Factor Analysis (6 Factors):

Communality:

As the number of factors increased, communalities generally increased.
Variables like x5_angry, x8_irritated, x9_approach, and x17_friends consistently showed high communalities.
Factor Loading:

The 6-factor model maintained a good balance between simplicity and interpretability.
Factor loadings above 0.3 were considered, and items with consistent high loadings on a single factor were deemed well-defined.
Factor Correlation:

Cumulative variance for the 6-factor model was the highest (41%).
Moderate correlations between factors, with negative correlations indicating a degree of orthogonality for certain factors.
Table 1: Standardized Factor Loading Estimates, Communalities, and Factor Correlations (6 Factors):

Provides detailed loading estimates for each indicator on the six factors.

Output:
Output and summary statistics for each factor analysis (4, 5, and 6 factors) are provided in the code output.
Conclusion:
The 6-factor solution is recommended based on the analysis, providing a comprehensive understanding of the underlying structure of personality items.
